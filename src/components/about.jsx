          Itâ€™s time for me to finally admit it out loud - I have a coding problem. In college, my passion for coding had manifested itself into a CS minor.
          In between my rigorous engineering courses, I always had one or two spare projects; even during finals week.
          The pinnacle of my epidemic transpired in my last occupation, when I became a full-stack engineer by day and structural Engineer-In-Traing (E.I.T)
          by late afternoon.

          In July of this year I graduated from a full-time web-development course with less than 3% acceptance rate.
          Finally, after 6 years of programming, I no longer have a coding problem; I now have a software-engineering career.
