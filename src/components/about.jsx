              Itâ€™s time for me to finally admit it out loud - <b>I have a coding problem</b>. In college, my <b>passion</b> for
              coding had <b>manifested</b> itself into a CS minor.
              In between my rigorous engineering courses, I always had one or two <b>spare</b> projects; even during finals week.
              The pinnacle of my <b>epidemic</b> transpired in my last occupation,when I became a full-stack engineer by <b>day</b> and structural
              Engineer-In-Training (E.I.T) by <b>late afternoon</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In June of last year I <b>graduated</b> from civil to full-stack engineering for the City and County of San Francisco.
              Finally, after 6 years of programming, I no longer have a coding <b>problem</b>; I now have a software-engineering <b>career</b>.
